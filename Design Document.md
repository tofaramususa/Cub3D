In the simplest form what we are doing is getting distance from the wall;
Then we use that distance to draw a vertical line
Then we add textures to the walls
That's it everything else is just extra's

Notes on the line:
When we know start and bottom colors then we can know when to color the remainder of the walls

To do list:


Another way to think of it:
- Map initialization and Window Creation
- Raycasting and texture to walls
- Rendering
- Player movement


First goal:
- Have something on the window using a fake 2dmap line and using mlx_library
